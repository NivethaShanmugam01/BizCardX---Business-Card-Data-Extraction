# BizCardX---Business-Card-Data-Extraction

BizCardX is a Python application that allows users to upload an image of a business card and extract relevant information from it using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). This information includes the company name, card holder name, designation, mobile number, email address, website URL, area, city, state, and pin code. The extracted information can be displayed in the application's graphical user interface (GUI), and users can save it to a database. Users can also read, update, and delete the stored data through the Streamlit UI.
